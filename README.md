A simple perceptron in python for educatives purposes.

# Readme
Hi Barzi, i'm now writing for you a little documentation with the functioning of a perceptron, after we both can enhace this project in a very best thing, but for now, this is what we have.

# Perceptron
What i was saying, the first step to start the project is develop a perceptron.
A perceptron is a model of neuron for a IA, the perceptron have two inputs and one ouput, and another parts what i explain after, in python, i'm thinking in use a OOP how paradigm, is very usefull for these cases.
In general, you can see the model in the next image:

Do not panic! Hahaha, it is simpler than it looks, it is the model of a complex perceptron A.K.A multilayer perceptron. The diference between the multilayer perceptron and the simple perceptron are the number of inputs and weights, a simple perceptron has only two inputs, and one weight for each input, and the multilayer has more than two inputs/weights.
The weight is the matter of a input, you can see it like a... In the icecream, it matters more the flavor than the color, for a IA, the flavor has more weight than the color, can you understand? The input is only a value, this input can be added by any way, for example, the camera, the input of a shell, and a lot of other cases.
Another elements of the model are the transfer function and the activation function, one each time:

# The transfer function
How you told me that you do not like mathematics, i take the opportunity to explain you the mathematics parts of the info that nobody explain but all have.

This is an expression that explain mathematically the transfer function.

For you, this means that each input is multiplied for its weight, after, the product of the multiplication is added to the other product of the other input... This value is really important, remind it like the "transfer function value", i will sumamarize the "transfer function value" as "t", it for simplify the notation of the activation function.

Now, the another part (the last part for now) of a perceptron is the...

# The activation function
This is an expression that explain mathematically the activation function, like the case of the transfer function, i will traduce it, remind the "transfer function value" as "t", okey?

This means that the perceptron (the phi symbol) has only two ouputs, 1 if the output value of the transfer function is greater than the umbral (the theta symbol), the umbral are the value that serve like a margin or a line, to explain easily, you can see it like when you touch a object, if the object is cold, you can say "Oh, that cold!" and is the object is hot, you can say "Oh, is hot!", for the IA, the umbral are that line between the cold and the hot, if the object is hot, he touch it and the perceptron has a output of 1 (the umbral were passed), if he touch it and the object is cold, the perceptron has a output of 0 (the umbral were not passed), or, if you configure another thing, the perceptron can react to the cold with a 1, and to the hot with a 0.

# Finally
that is how work a perceptron (really, the explainnation work with another cases), if all for now, if you have a doubt, write me to the faceboook.

P.S: Sorry if something is not really that i not want mean, remind that i am not a native speaker. Hahaha.
